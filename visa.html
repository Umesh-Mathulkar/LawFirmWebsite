    <h2 style="text-align:center; ">Immigration <span style="color:green;"> Visa </span> Services</h2>

    <img src="images/2.jpg" class="visa">

    <h5 id="info">A visa is a legal document that enables the bearer to enter a foreign country legally. The bearer’s
      passport is normally stamped or affixed with the visa. There are a variety of visas available, each of which
      grants the bearer the permission to either live, work, tour or study in the country.

    </h5><br><br>
    <h4 style=" text-align: center; color: red">Here is a list of common types of visas:</h4><br><br>
    <div style="margin: 0 5%;">
      <h3>Permanent <span style="color: red"> residency </span></h3>
      <p>A PR visa, or Permanent Resident Visa, allows you to travel to a nation, stay for a period of time, and then
        seek for citizenship. In some countries, obtaining a PR visa eventually leads to citizenship.</p>
      <br>
      <h3>Vis<span style="color: red">it </span></h3>
      <p>Visit visas are non-immigrant visas that are required if an individual wishes to enter a country temporarily
        for business, tourism, or transit when travelling by air or ship.</p>
      <br>
      <h3>Stu<span style="color: red">dy </span></h3>
      <p>Students enrolled in recognized educational institutions in foreign countries are granted a student visa.
        Non-immigrant visas are available for students. Students who intend to pursue higher education in another nation
        must apply for a student visa in order to study there.</p>
      <br>
      <h3>Wo<span style="color: red">rk </span></h3>
      <p>A work visa allows you to travel to another nation and work for a set amount of time. For work permit visas,
        different nations may have distinct procedures and qualifying requirements. These visas are available in two
        types: temporary and permanent. A temporary work visa is only valid for a set amount of time and must be renewed
        if the visa holder wants to extend his stay. In most cases, the employer is the one who applies for a work
        permit visa. The employer will submit a visa application to the immigration authority of a specific country.</p>
      <br>

      <h3>Busi<span style="color: red">ness </span></h3>
      <p>Travelers who intend to perform business operations and meetings that are not tied to work in that nation are
        issued business visas by government officials in that country.</p>
      <h5> A business visa permits the holder to do the following:</h5>
      <p> <span style="color: red">| </span>Participate in meetings.
        <span style="color: red">| </span>Attend conferences and business events
        <span style="color: red">| </span>Investigate new business ventures and opportunities
        <span style="color: red">| </span>
      </p>
      <br>
      <h3>Invest<span style="color: red">or </span></h3>

      <p>Countries issue investor visas to encourage people with an established business track record and a genuine
        desire to start a business in another country to invest in their country. This can be a new business endeavor or
        the purchase of an existing international company.

      </p>
      <p>Immigrant Investor Programs are designed to attract potential immigrant investors with sufficient personal
        wealth and managerial skills. Any business, with the exception of those that operate for the purpose of gaining
        interest or capital gains, qualifies for this program.

      </p>
      <p>Every country that grants an investment visa has its unique set of criteria and restrictions.
      </p>
      <br>
      <h3>Depend<span style="color: red">end </span></h3>
      <p>A dependent visa is a sort of visa that allows spouses and children to go to another country to accompany or
        join a family member who has a matching Visa.</p>
      <p>Dependents of a lawful migrant to a country, such as spouse, dependent children, or parents, can enter and
        reside in the country with a dependent visa. Dependents of migrants can seek for a visa to join them in the
        nation.</p>
      <p>Applying for a visa can be a stressful prospect. With an endless train of paperwork and documentation, it can
        quickly become overwhelming. DHBHAF has the knowledge, experience, and robust processes to help you navigate
        complex visa procedures and file your visa application with greater confidence.</p>
      <p>Each country offers different types of visa base on the purpose of your visit. Though you can apply for a visa
        to most countries online. It will take some time for you to understand the process, get the required documents,
        and fill the application form. You must ensure that you meet the eligibility requirements and requirements
        specific to the country you wish to move to.</p>
      <p>Remember there are different requirements for a student visa, a tourist visa, a work visa, etc. You must
        understand the specific requirements of the visa you are applying for and fill the application form and follow
        the other processes to get your visa.</p>
      <p>This is where the advice of a visa counselor or a visa advisor will be valuable to help you understand the
        different visas available and the specific requirements for your visa. A visa counselor will help you with the
        application process to successfully procure your visa.</p>
